## 🌟 Features

+ High-fidelity, hierarchical Real2Sim generation for both background node and interactive scene nodes in various complex real-world scenarios, leveraging advanced laser-scanning, generative models, physically-based re-lighting, and Mesh-Gaussian transfer. 
+ Efficient simulation and user-friendly configuration. By seamlessly integrating 3DGS rendering engine, MuJoCo physical engine, and ROS2 robotic interface, we provide an easy-to-use, massively parallel implementation for rapid deployment and flexible extension. The overall throughput of DISCOVERSE can achieve 650 FPS for 5 cameras rendering RGB-D frames, which is ∼3× faster than ORBIT (Issac Lab). 
+ Compatibilities with existing 3D assets and inclusive supports for robot models (robotic arm, mobile manipulator, quadrocopter, etc.), sensor modalities (RGB, depth, LiDAR), ROS plugins, and a variety of Sim&Real data mixing schemes. DISCOVERSE lays a solid foundation for developing a comprehensive set of Sim2Real robotic benchmarks for end-to-end robot learning, with real-world tasks including manipulation, navigation, multi-agent collaboration, etc., to stimulate further research and practical applications in the related fields.

## 🐳 Docker

Please refer to [docker deployment](doc/docker.md), or directly download [v1.6.1 docker images](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mLC3Hz-m78Y6qFhurwb8VQ?pwd=xmp9). If docker is used, the `📦 Install` and `📷 Photorealistic/Preparation 1-3` parts can be skipped.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TATP-233/DISCOVERSE.git --recursive
cd DISCOVERSE
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### Download Resource Files

Download the `meshes` and `textures` folders from [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1y4NdHDU7alCEmjC1ebtR8Q?pwd=bkca) or [Tsinghua Netdisk](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/0b92cdaeb58e414d85cc/) and place them under the `models` directory. After downloading the model files, the `models` directory will contain the following contents.

```
models
├── meshes
├── mjcf
├── textures
└── urdf
```

## 📷 Photorealistic Rendering

### Preparation

The physical engine of `DISCOVERSE` is [mujoco](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco). If the user does not need the high-fidelity rendering function based on [3DGS](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting), this section can be skipped. If photorealistic rendering is required, please follow the instructions in this subsection.

1. Install CUDA. Please install the corresponding version of CUDA according to your graphics card model from the [download link](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive).
2. pip install -r requirements_gs.txt
3. Install `diff-gaussian-rasterization`

    ```bash
    cd submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization/
    git checkout 8829d14
    ```
    Modify line 154 of `submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization/cuda_rasterizer/auxiliary.h`,
    change `(p_view.z <= 0.2f)` to `(p_view.z <= 0.01f)`.

    ```bash
    cd ../..
    pip install submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization
    ```

4. Prepare 3DGS model files. The high-fidelity visual effect of `DISCOVERSE` depends on 3DGS technology and corresponding model files. The pre-reconstructed robot, object, and scene models are placed on Baidu Netdisk [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1y4NdHDU7alCEmjC1ebtR8Q?pwd=bkca) and Tsinghua Netdisk [link](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/0b92cdaeb58e414d85cc/). After downloading the model files, the `models` directory will contain the following contents. (Note: Not all models are necessary. Users can download according to their own needs. It is recommended to download all ply models except those in the `scene` directory, and for the models in the `scene` folder, only download the ones that will be used.)

```
models
├── 3dgs
│   ├── airbot_play
│   ├── mmk2
│   ├── tok2
│   ├── skyrover
│   ├── hinge
│   ├── object
│   └── scene
├── meshes
├── mjcf
├── textures
└── urdf
```

### Online Viewing of 3DGS Models

If you want to view a single ply model, you can open [SuperSplat](https://playcanvas.com/supersplat/editor) in the browser, drag the ply model into the webpage, and you can view and perform simple editing. The webpage effect is as follows.

### Imitation Learning Quick Start

We currently provide the entire process of data collection, model training, and inference of the act algorithm in the simulator. You can refer to [Data Collection and Format Conversion](./doc/data.md), [Training](./doc/training.md), [Inference](./doc/inference.md), and refer to the corresponding tutorials.
